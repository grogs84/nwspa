In middel school I had a teacher who would play a game with us to kill time at the end of the day. I later learned the game was a version of the Monty Hall problem.  The teacher had three cards: 1 King and 2 Jokers. The cards were laid face down with the teacher knowing where each was. The goal is to pick the King. A student would select a card. Without revealing the card the student picked the teach would turn over a Joker. At this point the class had the option of staying with the selected card or switching.

While the class never caught on I later learned that after picking our initial card, it was always a better strategy to switch after the teach revealed the Joker. I'll attempet to explain why using Baye's Theorm.

My analysis is based on this website:

Lets start with the assumption that the King is acutally the first card (however the class does not know that). This will hopefully make things a little more clear.

So to start, the probability of selecting the King is 1/3 for each of the 3 cards:

P(card 1) = 1/3
P(card 2) = 1/3
P(card 3) = 1/3

Lets assume the class selects card 1.

Now we are going to stat the problem now as 'What is the probability of card 1 being the King, given the teacher shows us card 2 is a Joker'

P(card 1 = King | Teacher shows card 2 is joker) == ?

This can be stated using Baye's Theorm:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(card 1 = King | Teacher shows card 2 is joker) = P( Teacher shows card 2 is joker | card 1 = king) * P(card 1 = King) / P(Teacher shows card 2 is joker)

At this point, given the class selected card 1, the teacher has a 50/50 chance of showing us card 2 is a joker(He can't select card 1, and we know based on our assumpitions that card 2 and card 3 are Jokers)

Let's start listing some of our probabilities:

P(Teacher shows card 2 is joker | card 1 = king) = 1/2
P(card 1 = King) = 1/3
P(Teacher shows card 2 = joker) = (1/3)*(1/2) + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/2

The last line is where I had to really refrence the article several times to wrap my head around it.

I had to think about it like this. The King can be in three possible locations. We picked the first. If the King is in the first locatin there is a 50/50 chance the teacher selects card 2 to show teh Joker. If the king is the second card there no chance the teach will select to show card 2 as the joker. If the King is the third card the teach always chooses to show card 2 because he can't show the card we picked (card 1) and he won't show the King (card 3).

Therefore the Teachers choice is dependent on our choice. If we select the king on our first choice, his choice of the remaining cards doesn't matter and is 50/50. If we select a joker on our first choice, he must choose the remaining Joker.

So plugging all these in we have:
P(card 1 = King | Teacher shows card 2 is joker) = (1/2 * 1/3)/(1/3*1/2 + 1/3*0 + 1/3*1) = 1/3

So our updated probability of card 1 being the King given the teacher showing card 2 as the joker is still 1/3. We know the probability of card 2 being King is zero because it was shown as Joker. Because probabilities have to sum to 1 the probability of card 3 being the king is 2/3. This shows there is a 2/3 chance of the King being under card 3 and we should switch our selection.

In this case our ultimite choice would be incorrect, however given the reasoning that our updated probabilty of winning doesn't change after the Teacher reveals the card for our first choice, but jumps to 66% for the remaining choice means our stategy should be to always switch our choices.
